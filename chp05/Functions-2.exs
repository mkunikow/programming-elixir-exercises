#Exercise: Functions-2
#Write a function that takes three arguments. If the first two are zero,
#return “FizzBuzz.” If the first is zero, return “Fizz.” If the second is zero,
#return “Buzz.” Otherwise return the third argument. Do not use any lan-
#guage features that we haven’t yet covered in this book.

fizbuzz = fn
  0, _, _  -> "Fizz"
  _, 0, _  -> "Buzz"
  _, _, a3 ->  a3
  end
